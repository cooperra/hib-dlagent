Description
===========

Primarily for use as a DLAGENT in makepkg.conf in Arch Linux, but generally
useful when needing to download a particular Humble Bundle file via a script.

It also manages a storage directory where already downloaded file can be found.

Installation and Usage
======================

This utility currently requires humblebundle-python to query HumbleBundle's API.
It uses curl to download the file, or can simply provide the URL needed to
download the file so a different HTTP downloader such a Wget can be used.

To run hib-dlagent without installating it, add parameters '-S.', which
tells it to look for helper script(s) in the current directory.

By default hib-dlagent assumes the helper script is installed in
/usr/share/hib-dlagent. The provided Makefile will install files into this
location. If they are installed elsewhere, it is necessary to either run
hib-dlagent with the corresponding -S parameters, or edit the variables
SCRIPT_PATH and CONFIG_PATH in hib-dlagent.

To use as a DLAGENT for the 'hib' scheme, you can modify makepkg.conf:
DLAGENTS=(...
    'hib::/usr/bin/hib-dlagent -u user@example.org -o %o %u'
    ...)

Run with the -h argument for more information.
